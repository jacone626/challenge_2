          <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My names is James Alan, but I go by J.A., and I grew up in Wilmington, NC. Growing up, I loved fishing and surfing, but I was also a huge UNC fan. I was lucky enough to end up at UNC Chapel Hill, where I majored in Business and minored in Envrionmental Science.</p>
            <br>
            <p> After three years in the financial industry, I decided it was time for a change. The main thing I was looking for in my next career was the opportunity to think critically and problem-solve on the job. In previous jobs, I felt bogged down by monotonous calls and emails, and I was looking for something new. Following a few months of research, I found that coding not only satisfied my deisre to problem-solve, but it was also something I actually enjoyed!  </p>
