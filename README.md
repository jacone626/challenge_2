## Usage
The webpage is designed with a header at the top that links down to the corresponding section. For example, when you click on "Contact Me" at the top of the page, you will be directed to that section of the webpage. Further down, in the "Work" section, you will find photos that light up when you hover over them. By clicking on the photo, you will then be directed to a project that's related to the photo caption. At this time, only the "Run Buddy" photo links to a live webpage. In the final section, "Contact Me", you will find links to my phone number, email, and github. You can click on these links to be routed to the correct page.
